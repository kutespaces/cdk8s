# Playground

Welcome to the Playground!

We have set yourself up with an empty cdk8s project â€“ ready to hack away.

The `main.ts` file is synthesized to YAML for every change. You will see the output in the `playground.k8s.yaml` file that has been opened to the right.

If the Playground is not already running, go to the [**Kutespaces Inspector**](../doc/Kutespaces-Inspector.md) or use the `Kutespaces: Run Playground` command.

## Troubleshooting
